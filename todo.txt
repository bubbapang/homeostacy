make it so that if you hit super hot or cold, you die, and have a dead emoji and a little game over message, and the sim stops
make day a bit longer
make the game end, THEN you can restart sim, so you can see what stage you failed in

game balance the sim changing temp, the mood thresholds, and the player input strength

make a reset button when day ends
only reset sim when the player clicks the reset button
